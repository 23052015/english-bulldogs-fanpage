Testing
I tested this in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
Everything works perfectly. 
Bugs and problems
There was a big problem while processing the media querie max. 500px.The problem was a wide open space on the right. Fortunately I received a good advice from my mentor and solved the issue
by adjusting the PX an % values. 
Validator testing
HTML and CSS code were both validated in W3C and no errors were found. A warning came out for the Iframe element concerning muted and loope values so i
removed these two values. 
CSS was checked also on Jigsaw and proved that there are no mistakes. 
Furtherone, the  accessibility was checked with the extension "Lighthouse. The results are displayed on the graphic.

*Imprtant Note: The footer element was entirely copied from the love runing project. The youtube social media was removed.
**Beside that not a single code has been copied and pasted or taken from any other Website. Naturally during my project, I have done a lot of research throughout the 
web. Not one code was vopied from anywhere, some ideas from w3school are included but they are adjusted to fit my page.
